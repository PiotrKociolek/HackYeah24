Backend and frontend are just templates for further implementation :)
#TO open backend project u need to open solution file and perform migration, update-database in package manager console. In case of error try remove migrations and use commands" Add-Migration NameOfMigration" and then Update-Database. 

#Frontend
To open frontend app you need yarn. try yarn install and then yarn start.

#Caution! Frontend and backend are not connected!!! so test api on swagger (more than 95% of success) and visit our react app

Enjoy :) And Have a good day ;)
